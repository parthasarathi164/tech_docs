# Aircraft Navigation Instruments, Automatic Flight Control and Power Storage Systems

## Direct Reading Magnetic Compass

A direct reading magnetic compass is a self-contained, standalone navigation instrument that uses the Earth's magnetic field to provide heading information without requiring electrical power.

### Core Components

The assembly consists of several specialized parts to ensure accuracy and stability:

- **Magnetic Element:** A **compass card** with attached **sensing magnets** that align with Magnetic North.
    
- **Pivot System:** The card is mounted on an **iridium-tipped pivot** resting in a **sapphire cap** to provide a low-friction bearing.
    
- **Compass Bowl:** A liquid-filled housing that dampens card oscillations and protects the internal mechanism.
    
- **Bellows Expansion Unit:** Compensates for changes in fluid volume caused by temperature and pressure variations during flight.
    
- **Compensating Magnets:** Small internal magnets adjusted by **compensating screws** to counteract "deviation" caused by the aircraft's own magnetic fields.

### Essential Properties

For a direct reading compass to function efficiently, it must possess three critical properties:

- **Horizontality:** The magnetic element must remain horizontal during normal flight to accurately align with the Earth's magnetic lines of force. This is typically achieved by making the center of gravity of the card assembly lower than its pivot point.
    
- **Sensitivity:** The instrument must be responsive enough to detect even small changes in the aircraft's heading. High sensitivity is maintained through the use of strong sensing magnets and the low-friction sapphire/iridium pivot.
    
- **Aperiodicity:** The compass card should be "dead-beat," meaning it settles on a new heading quickly without excessive oscillation or swinging. This is achieved by the damping effect of the specialized fluid inside the compass bowl.

## Terrestrial and Aircraft Magnetism

### Terrestrial Magnetism

![[Pasted image 20260223185914.png]]

Terrestrial magnetism refers to the Earth acting as a giant bar magnet, creating a magnetic field that surrounds the planet.

- **Magnetic Poles:** The Earth has Magnetic North and South Poles, which are slightly offset from the geographic (True) poles.
    
- **Magnetic Flux:** Lines of magnetic force flow from the South Magnetic Pole to the North Magnetic Pole.
    
- **Dip (Inclination):** Near the equator, magnetic lines are horizontal; near the poles, they dip vertically toward the Earth. A compass must maintain **horizontality** to function against this dip.

### Aircraft Magnetism

![[Pasted image 20260223185832.png]]

Aircraft magnetism is the internal magnetic interference generated by the aircraft itself, which can distort the accuracy of a magnetic compass. It is divided into two main types:

- **Permanent Magnetism:** Caused by the steel parts of the airframe becoming permanently magnetized during manufacturing or through repeated exposure to the Earth's magnetic field. This creates a constant error regardless of heading.
    
- **Induced Magnetism:** Temporary magnetism created in soft iron parts of the aircraft as they pass through the Earth's magnetic lines of force. This error changes depending on the aircraft's heading and latitude.

---

### Correcting the Interference (Deviation)

To ensure the compass provides a reliable heading, the aircraft's magnetic interference must be neutralized:

- **Compensating Magnets:** Small internal magnets are adjusted using **compensating screws** to counteract the airframe's permanent magnetism.
    
- **Compass Swing:** A maintenance procedure where the aircraft is rotated on a "compass rose" on the ground to identify and record remaining errors (deviation) on a correction card.
    
- **Damping:** The compass bowl is filled with liquid to provide **aperiodicity**, ensuring the magnetic element settles quickly without excessive swinging.

## Remote Indicating (Gyro-Magnetic) Compass

![[Pasted image 20260223191448.png]]

A **Remote Indicating Compass** (or Gyro-Magnetic Compass) combines the long-term directional stability of a **gyroscope** with the north-seeking capability of a **magnetic compass** to provide an accurate, stable heading. It is "remote" because the magnetic sensor is located away from the cockpit (usually in a wingtip) to minimize aircraft magnetic interference.

### Core Components

- **Flux Valve (Flux Gate):** The sensing element located in a magnetically "clean" area of the aircraft. It detects the Earth's magnetic field and sends electrical signals to the system.
    
- **Directional Gyro (DG):** Provides short-term stability, preventing the heading indicator from "swinging" or oscillating during turns and turbulence.
    
- **Slaving Mechanism:** Continuously compares the gyro's heading with the magnetic data from the flux valve. It slowly "slaves" (corrects) the gyro to align with Magnetic North, eliminating **gyro drift**.
    
- **Heading Indicator:** The cockpit display that receives the stabilized signal to show the pilot a constant, reliable heading.    

---

### Key Advantages

- **Stability (Aperiodicity):** Unlike a direct reading compass, it does not swing wildly during maneuvers due to the stabilizing effect of the gyro.
    
- **Reduced Interference:** Placing the sensor in the wingtip significantly reduces **aircraft magnetism** errors (deviation) caused by cockpit electronics.
    
- **Elimination of Errors:** Corrects for typical magnetic compass flaws, such as northerly turning error and acceleration error.
    
- **Multi-Display Capability:** A single remote sensor can provide heading data to multiple systems, including the autopilot, primary flight displays, and flight data recorders.

## Magnetic Heading Reference System (Heading Indicator)

![[Pasted image 20260223191958.png]]

![[Pasted image 20260223192333.png]]

A modern **Heading Indicator**, often used with gyro-magnetic compasses, provides the flight crew with a stabilized and comprehensive directional reference.

### Key Features and Functionality

- **Radio Magnetic Indicator (RMI):** In addition to magnetic headings, this instrument can display bearings to ground-based radio navigation stations like **ADF** (Automatic Direction Finding) and **VOR** (VHF Omni-directional Range).
    
- **Heading Selection:** Pilots use a **"set heading" knob** to position a **heading bug** on the compass card, providing a clear visual target for manual flight.
    
- **Autopilot Integration:** The heading knob is mechanically coupled to a **data selsyn**, which sends steering commands to the autopilot system for automatic course tracking.
    
- **Modern Evolution:** While dedicated dial indicators remain common, the primary heading reference in advanced cockpits has largely transitioned to digital displays like the **EFIS** (Electronic Flight Instrument System) or **HSI** (Horizontal Situation Indicator).

Here is a breakdown of how modern autopilot systems and their related subsystems function.

## Auto Pilot

### Core Autopilot Control Architecture

**Inner and Outer Loop Control**

Autopilot systems are typically structured around a cascaded loop architecture.

- **Inner Loop (Stability and Control):** This is the foundation. It operates at a high frequency to stabilize the aircraft's dynamics. It takes inputs from rate gyros and accelerometers to control pitch, roll, and yaw rates, effectively keeping the aircraft flying straight and level or achieving a specific attitude commanded by the outer loop.
    
- **Outer Loop (Guidance and Navigation):** This loop operates at a lower frequency and handles the flight path. It processes data from navigation systems (GPS, ILS, Air Data) to determine where the aircraft needs to go (e.g., a specific heading or altitude). It then generates the required attitude commands (setpoints) and feeds them into the inner loop to execute.
    

**Control Surface Actuation**

Once the autopilot computes the necessary corrections, the Flight Control Computer (FCC) sends electrical signals to the control surface actuators. In large aircraft, these are typically Electro-Hydraulic Servo Valves (EHSV). The electrical signal dictates the flow of hydraulic fluid, which mechanically drives the actuators moving the ailerons, elevators, and rudder.

**Torque Limiters**

Torque limiters are mechanical slip clutches or electronically controlled force limiters installed between the autopilot servo motor and the aircraft's flight control cables/linkages. Their primary purpose is safety. If the autopilot commands a hardover (an extreme, erroneous maneuver), the pilot can physically grab the yoke and overpower the autopilot. Once the pilot's force exceeds the torque limiter's threshold, the clutch slips, allowing manual control without damaging the mechanical linkages.

**Autopilot Engagement & Synchronization**

To prevent the aircraft from jerking violently when the autopilot is turned on, the system must perform a "bump less transfer." While the autopilot is turned off, the flight control computers continuously monitor and "synchronize" with the aircraft's current pitch, roll, and surface positions. When engaged, the autopilot initializes its control loops using these current states as the starting zero-point, ensuring a smooth transition of control.

### Pilot-Autopilot Interfacing

**Control Wheel Steering (CWS)**

CWS acts like power steering for an aircraft. Instead of turning the autopilot off to maneuver, the pilot applies force to the control yoke. Force sensors in the yoke detect this pressure and signal the autopilot to move the control surfaces accordingly. Once the pilot releases the pressure, the autopilot captures and holds the new pitch and roll attitude.

**Touch Control Steering (TCS)**

TCS, sometimes called Pitch Sync, is similar to CWS but relies on a button rather than force sensors. When the pilot presses and holds the TCS button on the yoke, the autopilot servos temporarily declutch. The pilot manually flies the aircraft to a new attitude. Upon releasing the TCS button, the clutches re-engage, and the autopilot synchronizes to and holds the newly established attitude.

### Autopilot Command Modes

Autopilots use specific modes to define what the outer loop is trying to achieve.

**Lateral (Roll) Modes:**

- **HDG (Heading Hold/Select):** The aircraft rolls to capture and maintain a specific magnetic heading set by the pilot.
    
- **LNAV (Lateral Navigation):** The autopilot tracks a pre-programmed route supplied by the Flight Management Computer (FMC) or GPS.
    
- **LOC (Localizer):** The system intercepts and tracks the lateral radio beam of an Instrument Landing System (ILS) to align with the runway centerline.
    

**Vertical (Pitch) Modes:**

- **ALT (Altitude Hold):** Maintains the current barometric altitude.
    
- **V/S (Vertical Speed):** Maintains a specific rate of climb or descent (e.g., -1000 feet per minute).
    
- **FLCH / SPD (Flight Level Change / Speed):** The aircraft pitches up or down to maintain a specific airspeed while climbing or descending. Engine thrust is usually fixed at climb or idle power.
    
- **VNAV (Vertical Navigation):** Tracks a vertical descent or climb profile calculated by the FMC to optimize fuel and meet altitude restrictions.
    
- **G/S (Glideslope):** Intercepts and tracks the vertical radio beam of an ILS to maintain the correct descent angle to the runway threshold.
    
- **APP (Approach):** Arms both the LOC and G/S modes simultaneously for a precision instrument approach.
    

### Redundancy and Automated Landings

**Fail Passive vs. Fail Operational Systems**

- **Fail Passive:** If a system failure occurs, the autopilot disconnects and alerts the pilot. The key is that the failure does not cause any significant deviation in the flight path or out-of-trim condition ("passive" failure). The pilot must take over manually. This is typically standard for Category II ILS approaches.
    
- **Fail Operational:** The system has multiple redundancies (usually three independent flight control computers). If one computer fails, the system identifies the faulty unit, isolates it, and the remaining computers continue to fly the aircraft safely to a landing. This architecture is required for Category III autoland operations, where visibility is near zero.
    

**Automatic Landing Sequence**

An autoland operation generally follows these automated phases:

1. **Approach (LOC and G/S Capture):** The aircraft tracks the localizer and glideslope beams down toward the runway.
    
2. **Alignment (De-crab):** If there is a crosswind, the aircraft flies with a "crab" angle. Shortly before touchdown (around 150 feet), the autopilot uses the rudder to align the nose with the runway centerline and drops a wing into the wind to counteract drift.
    
3. **Flare:** At roughly 50 feet above the runway, the autopilot pitches the nose up to reduce the descent rate for a smooth touchdown, while the auto-throttle retards the engines to idle.
    
4. **Rollout:** After touchdown, the autopilot uses the rudder and nose-wheel steering to keep the aircraft perfectly centered on the runway while applying automatic braking.
    

### Integrated Flight Subsystems

**Auto Throttle Signal Interfacing**

The auto-throttle system manages engine thrust. It interfaces heavily with the Air Data Computer (for airspeed and Mach number), the FMC (for optimal thrust limits), and engine sensors (monitoring N1 RPM or Engine Pressure Ratio). The auto-throttle computer outputs electrical signals to servo motors that physically move the throttle levers in the cockpit, working in tandem with the autopilot's pitch modes to manage energy.

**Yaw Damper**

The yaw damper is an independent, high-frequency inner-loop system designed to prevent "Dutch Roll" (an unstable coupling of rolling and yawing oscillations). It uses a yaw rate gyro to detect lateral acceleration and commands the rudder to counteract the motion. Crucially, it does this in the background without moving the physical rudder pedals in the cockpit, ensuring the pilot isn't constantly fighting the system.

**Auto Pitch Trim System**

When the autopilot commands the elevator to hold a specific pitch, aerodynamic forces act continuously against that surface. To relieve these sustained loads, the auto pitch trim system slowly adjusts the entire horizontal stabilizer (the tailplane). By trimming out the aerodynamic forces, the elevator can return to its neutral position. This ensures the autopilot always has its full range of elevator authority available for sudden maneuvers or corrections.

## Aircraft Batteries

### Types of Aircraft Batteries

Commercial and general aviation aircraft predominantly rely on two types of batteries, each with distinct chemical and electrical characteristics.

**1. Lead-Acid Batteries**

Common in general aviation and some smaller turbine aircraft, these function similarly to automotive batteries but are constructed to prevent catastrophic spilling during flight maneuvers. They typically come in Flooded (vented) or Valve-Regulated Lead-Acid (VRLA) sealed formats.

- **Pros:** Relatively inexpensive, straightforward state-of-charge monitoring (voltage drops steadily as it discharges), and reliable for starting engines.
    
- **Cons:** Heavier for the amount of power they provide, subject to sulfation if left discharged, and their voltage drops off significantly under heavy loads or cold temperatures.
    

**2. Nickel-Cadmium (Ni-Cd) Batteries**

Ni-Cd batteries are the standard for large commercial jets and high-performance turboprops.

- **Pros:** They maintain a remarkably flat and consistent voltage output right up until they are almost completely depleted. They can deliver massive bursts of current for starting large turbine engines and perform exceptionally well in extreme cold.
    
- **Cons:** Expensive, highly susceptible to "memory effect" if not maintained properly, and notoriously difficult to determine their state of charge just by measuring voltage (because the voltage remains constant until the very end).
    

---

### Charging Profiles: Constant Voltage vs. Constant Current

The chemistry of the battery dictates how the aircraft's electrical system (or ground cart) must charge it.

- **Constant Voltage (CV) Charging:** This is the standard method for **Lead-Acid** batteries. The charger applies a fixed voltage (e.g., 28V for a 24V system). As the battery charges, its internal voltage rises to match the charger. Because the difference in voltage narrows, the charging current naturally tapers off, preventing overcharging.
    
- **Constant Current (CC) Charging:** This is the preferred method for maintaining **Ni-Cd** batteries. The charger forces a specific, steady amperage into the battery, allowing the voltage to fluctuate as needed. This ensures all individual cells within the Ni-Cd pack reach 100% capacity simultaneously, balancing the pack and preventing a hazardous condition known as thermal runaway.
    

---

### Thermal Runaway

Thermal runaway is a dangerous, self-sustaining positive feedback loop that destroys batteries and can cause aircraft fires. It is a specific vulnerability of **Ni-Cd** (and Lithium-ion) batteries, particularly if they are charged using a Constant Voltage system.

1. As a Ni-Cd battery gets hot (due to high ambient temps or heavy use), its internal electrical resistance actually _drops_.
    
2. If connected to a Constant Voltage bus, the lower resistance causes the battery to draw _more_ current.
    
3. More current generates _more_ heat.
    
4. The increased heat further drops the resistance, drawing even more current, until the electrolyte boils, the cells melt, and the battery fails catastrophically.
    
    To mitigate this, Ni-Cd equipped aircraft have dedicated temperature sensors in the battery case that disconnect the battery from the charging bus if it gets too hot.

### Storage Characteristics

The storage requirements for these two chemistries are exact opposites:

- **Lead-Acid:** Must be stored **fully charged**. If stored in a discharged state, lead sulfate crystals permanently harden on the plates (sulfation), destroying the battery's capacity.
    
- **Ni-Cd:** Ideally stored **fully discharged** and short-circuited (with a specialized strap across the terminals). Storing them charged degrades their capacity over time.
    

---

### Maintenance, Inspection, and Installation

When designing hardware that interfaces with aircraft power—such as an STM32-based flight controller—the power management circuitry must be robust enough to handle the realities of these batteries. It needs to tolerate severe voltage dips when a Lead-Acid battery cranks a starter, or handle the abrupt voltage cliff-edge when a Ni-Cd battery finally depletes, ensuring the microcontrollers don't experience a brownout. Keeping these main bus batteries healthy is highly regimented.

**Aircraft Battery Maintenance**

- **Deep Cycling (Ni-Cd):** Ni-Cd batteries undergo periodic deep cycling in a battery shop. They are completely discharged to zero volts to erase any "memory effect," and then recharged using a Constant Current profile to balance the cells.
    
- **Capacity Checks:** Because you can't check a Ni-Cd's capacity with a simple voltmeter, technicians must perform timed discharge tests, measuring exactly how many hours the battery can sustain a specific load.
    
- **Electrolyte Levels:** Vented batteries require regular checks of the electrolyte (water/acid) level, topping them up with distilled water as the water boils off during charging.
    

**Inspection and Installation**

- **Venting Systems:** Batteries generate highly explosive hydrogen gas when charging. Installation requires inspecting the battery box vent tubes, which use ram air from outside the aircraft to sweep dangerous gases out of the compartment.
    
- **Hardware and Torque:** High-current terminals must be torqued to specific manual limits. A loose connection creates electrical arcing and massive heat.
    
- **Corrosion Control:** Technicians inspect the battery tray for acid/alkali spills. Neutralizing agents (baking soda for lead-acid; vinegar/boric acid for Ni-Cd) are used to clean the area before applying anti-corrosion compounds to the terminals. _Crucially, lead-acid and Ni-Cd batteries must be serviced in entirely separate rooms to prevent cross-contamination of their respective acid and alkaline chemistries._
