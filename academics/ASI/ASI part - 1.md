#### Hydraulic Reservoir

![[Pasted image 20260210210300.png]]

This is a hydraulic **reservoir** with quantity‑sensing and protection circuits.

- The main tank (pink) stores fluid; suction line feeds the pump, and the pressure/return lines circulate fluid through the system.
- A nitrogen‑pressurized space (orange) maintains positive pressure on the fluid so the pump never cavitates.
- PRV (pressure relief valve) sends excess pressure to the drain line; NRV (non‑return valve) controls flow in the return line.
- Float or piston–linked micro‑switches give “below 1 litre” and “below/above 4 litre” electrical signals, which can operate the isolation valve and cockpit quantity lights to protect the system from low fluid.
